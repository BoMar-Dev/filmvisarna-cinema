# Filmvisarna Cinema

Welcome to the Filmvisarna AB website repository!

This project involves the development of a website for Filmvisarna AB, a small cinema chain aiming to compete locally with SF. The website is intended to provide information about movies being shown, allow users to watch trailers, and book cinema tickets online.

Feel free to explore other cinema sites for inspiration:

- Filmstaden - [link](https://www.filmstaden.se/)
- Less "artsy" cinemas, e.g., Cinema in Lund

## Technology Stack

The website uses the following technologies:

- React - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows developers to create reusable UI components and manage the state of their applications efficiently.
- Tailwind CSS - A utility-first CSS framework for creating custom designs with ease. It provides a set of pre-built classes that can be used to style HTML elements directly in the markup.
- Node.js - A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows developers to run JavaScript code on the server-side, enabling the development of scalable and high-performance web applications.
- Express - A fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js. It simplifies the process of building web applications and APIs by providing a robust set of features and middleware.
- MongoDB - A NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents. It offers high performance, scalability, and flexibility, making it suitable for a wide range of applications.
- Nodemailer - A module for Node.js applications that allows sending emails. It supports various email services and provides features such as attachments, HTML content, and SMTP authentication.
- Multer File Upload - A middleware for handling multipart/form-data, primarily used for uploading files in Node.js applications. It simplifies the process of handling file uploads and provides options for validation and storage.
